## As this standalone Add-on is falling behind the version integrated in the [ZG SWTOR Tools Add-on](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/ZG-SWTOR-Tools) in compatibility and features, we are deprecating it. Please use the ZG Tools instead.

# SWTOR Area Assembler
## by ZeroGravitas and Crunch
swtor_area_assembler is a Blender addon that imports Jedipedia.net's **[File Reader](https://swtor.jedipedia.net/reader)**-exported .json location data into Blender and parses it to auto-import and assemble the area's objects.

**At the moment we are updating this Add-on to work with a new version of the .gr2 Importer Add-on compatible with Blender 4.0.2. Until it is ready, please use the version of this tool integrated in the [ZeroGravitas SWTOR Tools Add-on](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/ZG-SWTOR-Tools) (it has more corrections and features than this one: please check them in its [Wiki pages](https://github.com/SWTOR-Slicers/WikiPedia/wiki/ZG-SWTOR-Tools-Add-on))**
